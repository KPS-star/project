3. When a product is added, it appears in the **Cart Section** with quantity and price updates.
4. Users can increase or decrease the number of items or remove them completely.
5. The total amount updates dynamically, and the cart data is stored locally.
6. A simple **Checkout** alert confirms the purchase (demo-only flow).
7. The app can be hosted and shared using a deployment link (e.g., Netlify or GitHub Pages).
